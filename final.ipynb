            "3. **Prevention Strategies**:\n",

            "   - **Insecticides**: Apply insecticides to control the pest population.\n",
            "   - **Biological Control**: Use biological controls like predatory insects or beneficial fungi to prevent pest infestations.\n",

Control Crop Rotation: Rotate crops to avoid the same crop being grown year after year on the same land. This helps reduce the population of pests like Colorado potato beetles that thrive on specific plant species. 2. Crop Rotation with NonPesticidal Methods: Use nonchemical methods such as biological control agents, physical barriers, and cultural practices to manage pests without using pesticides. 3. Insecticide Application: Apply insecticides specifically designed for controlling Colorado potato beetles if necessary but only when absolutely necessary due to their environmental impact. 4.
